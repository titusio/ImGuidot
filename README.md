# ImGUIdot

Library for using ImGui with the Godot Engine. GDScript and C#.

## Current State

This library is still in early development and not ready at all at this point.

## Contributing

Clone the Repository.
Run the following commands:

```
cd godot-cpp
git submodule update --init
scons
```

After that you can go up one directory and compile the extension:

```
cd ..
scons
```

Now the project should be compiled and can be tested out in the Editor!
